Place the logo image file (the attachment you provided) at:

  AI_Cyber_Security_Platform/static/img/logo.png

Requirements:
- File name: logo.png (PNG recommended)
- Path: `static/img/logo.png` (create the `img` directory if it doesn't exist)

After placing the file, reload the Flask app or refresh the page to see the logo in the top-left of the header.

If you'd like, I can try to save the attachment into that path for you — tell me to "save logo" and I'll attempt to write it into the workspace.
